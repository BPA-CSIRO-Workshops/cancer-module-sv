Overview
========
The README.md files found in each subdirectory of this repository provide documentation on the structure, function, and usage of the btp-module-template in the context of the BTP framework.

General Design/Layout
=====================
These types of workshop modules are designed to be self contained. That is they contain all the
required information to permit trainers to reuse and repurpose them quickly and easily. They contain
the following 4 major elements:

 * **[Handout](handout)** - This often includes background information, step-by-step exercises, questions and
   answers as well as bonus exercises for those who progress rapidly.
 * **[Data sets](datasets)** - This describes where to obtain the data sets, used in the handout exercises, and
   where on the computer system they should be located.
 * **[Tools](tools)** - This describes which tools are used in the handout exercises and how to install them.
 * **[Presentations](presentations)** - This is where you will find presentations for introducing concepts that are
   explored in the handout exercises.
